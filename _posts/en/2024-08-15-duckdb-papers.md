# Papers Adopted by DuckDB

[DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/) can handle analytical query workloads incredibly fast. 

On its official documentation page, there's a list named ["Standing on the Shoulders of Giants"](https://duckdb.org/why_duckdb.html#standing-on-the-shoulders-of-giants), and I've gone through some of them for my understanding of DuckDB itself and DB internals in general.

This series is my notes from them. Please feel free to ping me for anything you think I should add or read wrong.
